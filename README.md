## General Information
- We are working for a consumer finance company specializing in lending various loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is expected to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    * The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    * loan.csv
